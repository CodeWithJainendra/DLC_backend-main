Subject: IP Whitelisting Request for Jeevan Pramaan API Access

Dear Sh. Anil Bansal Sir,

Thank you for providing the Jeevan Pramaan API specifications.

We have set up the integration on our server and are ready to test the API. However, we are currently receiving a 403 Forbidden error, which indicates that our IP address needs to be whitelisted.

Please whitelist the following IP address to enable access to the Jeevan Pramaan API:

**IP Address to Whitelist**: 103.246.106.145

**Purpose**: Integration with DLC Portal (IIT Kanpur) for pensioner data synchronization and Digital Life Certificate management.

**API Endpoint**: https://ipension.nic.in/JPWrapper/

Once the IP is whitelisted, we will:
1. Test the API with the date 05.11.2024 as suggested
2. Verify the data structure and payload handling (~300 MB, ~7 lakh records)
3. Complete the integration with our existing DLC system
4. Provide a detailed test report

Please let us know once the IP whitelisting is complete so we can proceed with testing.

Thank you for your support.

With Regards,
[Your Name]
IIT Kanpur
